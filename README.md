# About the Project
 The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# Team Role
## Backend
Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

## Frontend
Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.

## Quality assurance (QA) engineer
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.

## DevOps engineer
Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.

## UI/UX designer
A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

A UI/UX designer would accompany you throughout the development lifecycle, helping you achieve business goals via functional and engaging user experiences, as well as analyzing, evaluating, and enhancing those experiences over time.
